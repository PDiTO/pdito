👋 Hi there! I'm Paul 👨🏻‍💻

🚀 **Founder @ Perfect Dimension AI** – Building applied AI products that push the boundaries of what's possible. Product lead and full stack engineer who ships end-to-end.

📈 **Background**: Fixed income trader → Product lead at Broadway Technology ($500M exit) → Now building AI applications that solve real problems in novel ways.

🏆 **Track Record**:
- 🎮 Built a **#1 App Store game** with 7M downloads and 2.5B game sessions
- 💼 Led product strategy across trading, data, and UI/UX at Broadway Technology
- 🏅 6x hackathon winner across AI and web3
- 🤖 Currently building Perfect Dimension AI – creating applications that leverage cutting-edge AI in unexpected ways

🛠️ **How I Build**:
- 🎨 **Product & Design**: User research, UX/UI, strategy to launch
- 🧠 **AI/ML**: LLM integration, fine-tuning, agentic workflows, RAG systems
- 💻 **Engineering**: Python, TypeScript, Swift, Rust, Solidity
- 📊 **Domain Expertise**: Financial markets, Gaming, Artificial Intelligence, Web3/Crypto
- ⚡ **Development**: Power user of Claude Code, Codex CLI, and the latest AI tools

💡 **My Approach**:
With AI as a multiplier, I can move from concept to shipped product faster than ever. I handle product strategy, design the experience, and write the code. This integrated approach means fewer handoffs, faster iteration, and products that feel coherent from vision to implementation.

🚀 **Perfect Dimension AI**:
We're exploring the frontier of applied AI – building products that don't just use AI, but reimagine what's possible when you combine cutting-edge models with thoughtful product design and UI.
